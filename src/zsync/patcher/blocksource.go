/*
BlockSource is an interface used by the patchers to obtain blocks from the reference
It does not stipulate where the reference data might be (it could be local, in a pre-built patch file, on S3 or somewhere else)

It is assumed that the BlockSource may be slow, and may benefit from request pipelining & concurrency.
Therefore patchers should feel free to request as many block spans as they can handle.

A BlockSource may be a view onto a larger transport concept, so that multiple files can be handled with wider
knowledge of the number of simultaneous requests allowed, etc. The BlockSource may decide to split BlockSpans
into smaller sizes if it wants.

It is up to the patcher to receive blocks in a timely manner, and decide what to do with them, rather than
bother the BlockSource with more memory management and buffering logic.

Since these interfaces require specific structs to satisfy, it's expected that implementers will import this module.
